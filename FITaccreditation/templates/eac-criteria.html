                                Program educational objectives are broad statements that describe what graduates are expected
                                to attain within a few years after graduation. Program educational objectives are based on the needs of the programâ€™s 
                                constituencies.

                                Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. 
                                These relate to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.

                                <b>Assessment:</b><br>
                                Assessment is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to evaluate the attainment of student
                                outcomes. Effective assessment uses relevant direct, indirect, quantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate to the 
                                outcome being measured. Appropriate sampling methods may be used as part of an assessment process.

                                Evaluation is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence accumulated through assessment 
                                processes. Evaluation determines the extent to which student outcomes are being attained. Evaluation results in decisions and

                                <b>Engineering Design:</b><br>
                                Engineering design is a process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs and 
                                specifications within constraints. It is an iterative, creative, decision-making process in which the basic sciences, 
                                mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources into solutions. Engineering design involves identifying
                                opportunities, developing requirements, performing analysis and synthesis, generating multiple solutions, evaluating solutions
                                against requirements, considering risks, and making trade- offs, for the purpose of obtaining a high-quality solution under 
                                the given circumstances. For illustrative purposes only, examples of possible constraints include accessibility, aesthetics,
                                codes, constructability, cost, ergonomics, extensibility, functionality, interoperability, legal considerations, 
                                maintainability, manufacturability, marketability, policy, regulations, schedule, standards, sustainability, or usability.

                                The program faculty must have appropriate qualifications and must have and demonstrate sufficient authority to ensure the 
                                proper guidance of the program and to develop and implement processes for the evaluation, assessment, and continuing 
                                improvement of the program. The overall competence of the faculty may be judged by such factors as education, diversity of 
                                backgrounds, engineering experience, teaching effectiveness and experience, ability to communicate, enthusiasm for developing
                                more effective programs, level of scholarship, participation in professional societies, and licensure as Professional 
                                Engineers.

                                to attain the student outcomes and to support program needs. Students must be provided appropriate guidance regarding the
                                use of the tools, equipment, computing resources, and laboratories available to the program.
                                <br><br>
                                The library services and the computing and information infrastructure must be adequate to support the scholarly and 
                                professional activities of the students and faculty.

                                program must be adequate to meet program needs. The resources available to the program must be sufficient to attract, retain,
                                and provide for the continued professional development of a qualified faculty. The resources available to the program must 
                                be sufficient to acquire, maintain, and operate infrastructures, facilities, and equipment appropriate for the program, and
                                to provide an environment in which student outcomes can be attained.
