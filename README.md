######INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN LOCAL

Because Django uses a secret key and this codebase is going to be publicly on GitHub, you will need to be given an additional file 'local.bat' in order to run your local server. Put it in the same folder as 'manage.py' and execute it in the command line with './local.bat runserver'. Other 'manage.py' functions can be executed with 'python manage.py' (shell_plus, migrate, makemigragtions, etc.).
